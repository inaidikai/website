        <h2>üìú About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi! I'm Insha Kahar, a passionate and dedicated coding enthusiast and digital artist based in Abu Dhabi. Currently, I am furthering my skills at 42 Abu Dhabi, an institution renowned for its innovative project-based learning approach. My expertise lies primarily in C and Python programming, and I take pride in applying my technical skills to creative projects. My journey into the world of digital art and game development began with a strong fascination for the visual aesthetics of video games and interactive media. This passion led me to participate in various game jams, where I had the opportunity to explore and push the boundaries of my creativity and technical capabilities. One of the most rewarding experiences was receiving recognition for my outstanding visuals in a game jam hosted by Endless Studios, which solidified my commitment to pursuing a career that blends artistry and technology.
